# CODSOFT
This personal portfolio website is a self-developed project aimed at enhancing my skills in HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The website showcases my academic background, technical expertise, live projects, internship experiences, and achievements. Designed with a clean and responsive layout, the site demonstrates my ability to create user-friendly interfaces using modern front-end technologies. Through this project, I gained practical experience in website structuring, responsive design, and visual aesthetics, which helped strengthen my understanding of front-end development.
